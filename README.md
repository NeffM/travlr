Architecture

When it comes to the front-end development of my full-stack project, Express HTML can allow the server side to render HTML and integrate with the backend. It can be viewed as less dynamic when comparing the SPAS. JavaScript can be seen ensuring the behavior of the web pages is adequate. The focus was creating a MEAN stack for a client named Travlr. It was very challenging however rewarding. The client requested a login for single single-user account focus. This feature ensured that user information would be protected using encryption, and that single login information would be verified against the database. 


Testing

Testing the client's program is a different scenario. Included in the GET, POST, and PUT options we can view user feedback and return codes. Codes such as (202) would be returned to indicate a request was accepted, and ensuring these codes are being returned when accessing the GET, POST, and PUT functions was a necessity. Another testing would be ensuring a smooth transition between authentication and authorization was exemplary, and ensuring the API testing in Postman was handling expectations and ensuring endpoints. 

Reflection

This course posed many challenges, and when it relates to HTML it posed many roadblocks. When taking a full stack course, the course can help show where you excel, and where you could use more work. Taking the wins in the areas that work perfectly and areas that seem less user-friendly, can help shape a future, and truly help gain success in a full-stack development program. Completing this course helped shape a solid foundation, and positioned me as a competitive choice for a role that requires building a scalable, efficient web application
